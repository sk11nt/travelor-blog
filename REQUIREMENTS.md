Basically, project to manage posts and categories. Mini-Blog.

Basic Laravel Auth: ability to log in as administrator

Use database seeds to create first user with email admin@laravel.test and password “password”

CRUD functionality (Create / Read / Update / Delete) for two menu items: Post and Category.

Categories DB table consists of these fields: Name (required), Description.

Posts DB table consists of these fields: Title (required), Content (required), Category (foreign key to Categories), Published at (timestamp),

Use database migrations to create those schemas above

Use basic Laravel resource controllers with default methods – index, create, store etc.

Use Laravel make:auth as default Bootstrap-based design theme, but remove ability to register

Good luck!
